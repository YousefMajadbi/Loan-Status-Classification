# Loan-Status-Classification

## Objective
In this project we are going to find the most accurate ML Classifier Algorithm whcih will be used to predict the Loan Status for new or unkown users.

## Data Description
We are going to use a historical Loans data to predict the new\unkown users. 
We will use the [Loan_train.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YousefMajadbi/Loan-Status-Prediction/main/loan_train.csv) dataset to train and fit our model.
And use the [Loan_test.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YousefMajadbi/Loan-Status-Prediction/main/loan_test.csv) dataset to test and evaluate our built model.

Dataset includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted. It includes following fields:

| Field          | Description                                                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Loan_status    | Whether a loan is paid off on in collection                                           |
| Principal      | Basic principal loan amount at the                                                    |
| Terms          | Origination terms which can be weekly (7 days), biweekly, and monthly payoff schedule |
| Effective_date | When the loan got originated and took effects                                         |
| Due_date       | Since itâ€™s one-time payoff schedule, each loan has one single due date                |
| Age            | Age of applicant                                                                      |
| Education      | Education of applicant                                                                |
| Gender         | The gender of applicant                                                               |
